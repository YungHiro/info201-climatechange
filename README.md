## Domain of Interest
**Why are you interested in this field/domain?**

We are interested in the field of climate change as we believe that it has a major impact on every person's life regardless of ethnicity, race, nationality, age, gender, job etc. In order to prepare for the future, there is a dire need right now for a sense of acknowledgement within populations. Climate change has a lot of moving parts to it and can be daunting to understand so we believe that manipulating data may make it easier for us and others to absorb the individual impact it has on everyone's lives. We want to measure climate change variables through changing temperatures, CO2 levels, sea level pressures and see its impacts on geographical locations (to see those at a higher stake), agriculture and the economy.

**What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?**
- This [interactive database](https://airsofia.info/) maps out current median values of sensors in an area based on variables such as temperature, humidity, pressure and air quality index.
- This [article](https://zach-alexander.com/climate-change) utilizes python and data of temperature models to create data visualizations that map out and predict higher warming tendencies.
- This [research](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/93547/err-266.pdf?v=1221) paper conveys climate models that find correlations between patterns of temperature and precipitation on food supplies, farmers, and rural communities.
- This [data driven research paper](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/44987/28911_err136.pdf?v=9052.4) analyzes the impacts of climate change on agricultural crops based on quantification of temperature and precipitation.

**What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?**
- Which states have experienced the highest temperature change over time?
- When did the dramatic surge of CO2 levels occur?
- What variables have the highest impact on indicators of climate change?
- How will climate change affect the agricultural sector?
- Based on current temperature and precipitation trends, which cities will be heavily impacted by climate change and global warming in the near future?

## Finding data
- This data set, [International Greenhouse Gas Emissions](https://www.kaggle.com/unitednations/international-greenhouse-gas-emissions?select=greenhouse_gas_inventory_data_data.csv), was on Kaggle and was collected and developed by Parties to the Convention using scientific and methodological guidance from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This data set provides the information on anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of the greenhouse gases that are lack of being controlled by the Montreal Protocol. There are 8407 observations and 4 features in this data set. From this data set, we can answer which country has the most greenhouse gases emissions.  
- The data set, [Daily Temperatures of Major Cities](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/daily-temperature-of-major-cities), was found on Kaggle and was collected by a data scientist at H2O.ai, an open source software company in Silicon Valley.  There are 1,048,575 observations in this data set with eight features: region, country, start, city, month, day, year, and average temperature. This data set will go a long way in determining where the  highest changes in temperature occurred.
- This data set is the abnormalities for global temperature but specifically looking at North America. This [data set](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/global/haywood/globe/land_ocean) was found on the national centers for environmental information.  This data is also able to specifically categories based on region (north america / asia), countries, or longitudes and latitudes. They gathered this data by collecting daily temperature levels globally and they are able to see what is the biggest anomaly in terms of temperature for each year depending on the location you choose. The data set is set up so that you can pick specific regions (Asia, North America), countries ( USA, France, Germany) and specific coordinates. The data goes from 1880 - 2020, there are 140 rows. There are 3 defining features of the data set, which are: year, temperature, ranking. This data set will hopefully answer the question of  what cities are going to be greatly impacted by climate change and global warming in the future.
